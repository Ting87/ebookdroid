## How can I optimize viewable area in Ebookdroid? ##
EbookDroid offers several features to make the most out of the - usually scarce - screen real estate. Apart from the ordinary manually selectable zoom level (either by pinching in and out or via a comfy slider at the bottom of the screen), the following methods can be used to magnify the relevant parts of the document:
  * Split pages
  * Automatic crop margins
  * Manually crop margins (select and lock viewable area)
  * Zoom to a selected column of text
These methods are usually not necessarily mutually exclusive as it is for example possible to split a landscape page in two portrait pages, each one with its margins automatically cropped and it will still be possible to zoom in and out of single columns of text with a simple gesture. Please note that all these features can be applied on a per book basis, and EBookDroid will remember each book's specific settings.
The following points explain when a particular feature is needed and how to use it.
